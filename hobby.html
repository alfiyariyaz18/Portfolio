    <h2>Web Design</h2>
    <p>Web design has been a creative outlet and a technical challenge that I deeply enjoy. I am passionate about
        building visually appealing and user-friendly websites that provide a seamless experience across devices. Over
        the years, Iâ€™ve honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with responsive design and UI/UX principles.
        This hobby has not only sharpened my problem-solving skills but also kept me at the forefront of modern web
        design trends. I have completed several personal and freelance projects, including law firm websites and
        portfolio websites for lawyers. These experiences have enhanced my ability to merge design and
        functionality in a way that engages users and meets client goals.</p>
